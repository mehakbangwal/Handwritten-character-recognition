# HCR-Using-Deep-Learning
-> Involved the development of a deep learning model capable of accurately recognizing and classifying handwritten characters.    

-> Using CNN, built a system that takes an input image of a handwritten character and processes it through multiple convolutional layers to 
   extract relevant features. These features are then fed into fully connected layers to make predictions about the class or identity of the 
   character.    
   
-> Use the model to predict the handwritten characters in real time.
